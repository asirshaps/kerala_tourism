     <img src="images/ks2.jpg" alt="pic" hspace="25" align="left">
     <p>
        Built in the 17th century by Shivappa Nayak of Bedanoor, the Chandragiri Fort belongs to the chain of forts built by the same ruler. The fort is ten kilometers away from Bekal. The eventful history of the fort goes like this. The river Chandragiri was earlier considered to be the border of the two powerful kingdoms â€“ Kolathunadu and Thulunadu. When Thulunadu was captured by the Vijayanagara Empire, the Kolathunadu kings lost the Chandragiri region to them. During the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire the area was administratively looked after by the Keladi Nayakas of Ikkeri. In 16th century the Vijayanagara Empire fell and Vengappa Nayaka declared independence. Later Shivappa Nayak took over the reins. He built a chain of forts of which Chandragiri is part. This large fort is 150 feet above sea level and offers an astonishing view of the Chandragiri River and the Arabian Sea.
