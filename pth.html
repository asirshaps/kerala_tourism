     <p>
        The Sabarimala Temple is a temple complex located at Sabarimala inside the Periyar Tiger Reserve in the Perinad Village, Pathanamthitta district, Kerala, India.[1][2] It is one of the largest annual pilgrimage site in the world with an estimate of over 40 to 50 million devotees visiting every year.[3][4][5][6] The temple is dedicated to a Hindu celibate deity Ayyappan also known as Dharma Shasta, who according to belief is the son of Shiva and Mohini, the feminine incarnation of Vishnu.[7] The traditions of Sabarimala are a confluence of Shaivism, Shaktism, Vaishnavism, and other Śramaṇa traditions.[8]

        The temple is situated on a hilltop amidst eighteen hills at an altitude of 480 m (1,574 ft) above sea level, and is surrounded by mountains and dense forests. The dense forest, part of the Periyar Tiger Reserve, around the temple is known as Poongavanam. Temples exist in each of the hills surrounding Sabarimala. While functional and intact temples exist at many places in the surrounding areas like Nilakkal, Kalaketty, and Karimala, remnants of old temples survive to this day on remaining hills.

     <img src="images/pt2.jpg" alt="pic" hspace="25" align="left">
     <p>
        Kaviyoor is a small village, and was one of the ancient 64 Brahmin settlements of Kerala. It is located on the western bank of the river Manimala in the taluk of Thiruvalla in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala, India.

 

        An ancient rock cut temple “Kaviyoor Thrikkakkudi Cave Temple” is located here, carved on a huge rock and the carved rooms and sculptures are well preserved. This Cave Temple is of historical importance and is preserved as a monument by the Archaeological Department.The temple has a verandah with a sculpture of Lord Ganapathi carved into the wall and inner sanctum containing a tall shivalinga, all carved out of one huge rock. It bears close resemblance to the Pallava style of architecture. The engravings here are among the earliest specimens of stone sculptures in Kerala.

    <h3>ARANMULA</h3>
 </div>
 <img src="images/pt3.jpg" alt="pic" hspace="25" align="left">
 <P>
    Visitors to Pathanamthitta district are never really sure of what to expect from Aranmula. This is mostly due to the lore surrounding this exotic village, famous for the genius of its craftsmen and the ancient vibe one experiences the moment oneenters. Aranmula is famous for its Aranmula Kannadi (metal mirrors), the centuries’ old Sree Krishna Temple, the unique ritualistic feast of `Vallasadya,’ and famed Aranmula Boat Race and the list goes on.

    It gets its name from the centuries-old Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple (dedicated to Sree Krishna) on the banks of the holy River Pamba, a virtual hotbed of devotees. The murals, carvings and paintings here have inspired much awe and interest. It is also the venue for the Aranmula Vallasadya, a ritual offering to the deity Lord Parthasarathy in which the oarsmen of the snake boats are offered a feast. With over 70 dishes it is probably one of the largest vegetarian feasts in India.
