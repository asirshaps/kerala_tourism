        <h3>MAHE</h3>
     </div>
     <img src="images/kn1.jpg" alt="pic" hspace="25" align="left">
     <P>Mahé, also known as Mayyazhi, is a small town in the Mahé district of the Pondicherry Union Territory. It is situated at the mouth of the Mahé River and is surrounded by the State of Kerala. The Kannur District surrounds Mahé on three sides and Kozhikode District from one side.

        Formerly part of French India, Mahé now forms a municipality in Mahé district, one of the four districts of the Union Territory of Puducherry. Mahé has one representative in the Puducherry Legislative Assembly.The name Mahé derives from Mayyazhi, the name given to the local river and region in the Malayalam language. The original spelling found on French documents from the early 1720s is Mayé, with Mahé and Mahié also found on documents, maps and geographical dictionaries until the early 19th century when the spelling Mahé became the norm. Therefore, the belief that the name of the town was given in honour of Bertrand François Mahé de La Bourdonnais (1699–1753), whose later fame derived in good part from his association with India, including his capture of Mayé in 1741, is incorrect.

        <h3>ST ANGELO FORT</h3>
     </div>
     <img src="images/kn2.jpg" alt="pic" hspace="25" align="left">
     <P>In 1498, during Vasco da Gama's visit to India, the local Kolathiri king granted the land to Portuguese to build a settlement in present-day Kerala. On 23 October 1505, he gave the Portuguese leader Francisco de Almeida the permission to build a fort at the site. The construction activity began the very next day, on 24 October 1505, when Goncalo Gil Barbosa - the Portuguese factor of Cannanore (Kannur) - laid the foundation stone. The construction of the wooden fort was completed on 30 October 1505: its first Captain was Lourenco Britto, who led a garrison of 150 Portuguese men, and controlled two ships in the sea. After the fort was completed, Almeida began using the title "Viceroy", and in 1507, he started the construction of a stone fort at the site.[1]

        The fort was later attacked in vain by the local Indian ruler Zamorin and Kolathiri in the Siege of Cannanore (1507).

        <h3>EZHIMALA</h3>
     </div>
     <img src="images/kn3.jpg" alt="pic" hspace="25" align="left">
     <p>Ezhimala, a hill reaching a height of 286 metres, is located near Payyanur, in Kannur district of Kerala, south India. It is a part of a conspicuous and isolated cluster of hills, forming a promontory, 38 km north of Kannur (Cannanore) .

        As the former capital of the ancient Mushika Kingdom, Ezhimala is considered to be an important historical site. A flourishing seaport and center of trade around the beginning of the Common Era, it was also one of the major battlefields of the Chola-Chera Wars, in the 11th century. It is believed by some that Lord Buddha had visited Ezhimala.Ezhimala, which is part of Ramanthali panchayath, is one of the most important places in the recorded history of north Malabar. From before the period of known history, some chapters of the Ramayana and local Hindu legends associate the Ezhimala Hills with the famous epic, in particular with lord Hanuman.

        <h3>PARASSINIKKADAVU TEMPLE</h3>
     </div>
     <img src="images/kn4.jpg" alt="pic" hspace="25" align="left">
     <p>Parassinikadavu Muthappan temple is a temple, located at Anthoor Municipality on the banks of the Valapattanam river about 10 km from Taliparamba and 16 km from Kannur City in Kannur District, Kerala.[2][3] Principal deity of the temple is Sree Muthappan, whose divinity is presented as a ritualistic theyyam enactment in two versions called Thiruvappana and Vellattam. According to the local tradition the presiding deity is a manifestation of Lord Shiva.[4]

        Vellattam and Thiruvappana are the generic names for two types of ' Theyyam Ketti-aadal ' in the kavu/temples of North Malabar.
        
        Vellattom is a minor version of the ritual enactment where the ornaments, decorations and parapharnelia are minimal thanks to which all actions including vaaythari (speech) is maximum and Attam (dance) will be at its peak. If you compare this level of enactment to the idol of a deity in a temple sanctum which is installed as per sathwic sasthra and vedic rituals, Vellattom is at par with the idol alone without the prabha-mandalam which circles it. A more easier example is the Seeveli ceremony with only the small idol on top of the elephant.
        
        On the other hand, Thiruvappana is the full version, with royal regalia and bigger dimension of prabhamandalam. Because the decorations are more and are of binding nature, the action is minimal and sluggish and the uriyaadal (replies to prayers) will be crisp, to the point and predictions will be accurate.

        <h3>DHARMADAM ISLAND</h3>
     </div>
     <img src="images/kn5.jpg" alt="pic" hspace="25" align="left">
     <p>Dharmadam Island (Green Island) was a small 2 hectare private island in Thalassery, Kannur District, Kerala. It lies 100 metres from the mainland at Dharmadam. This island, covered with coconut palms and dense bush is a beautiful sight from the Muzhappilangad beach. During low tide, one can walk out to it from the beach. Permission is required to land on the island . Dharmadam, known earlier as Dharmapattanam, was a Buddhist stronghold.

        In 1998, Kerala Government took over this land for tourism development.[1] Dharmadam is located 4 km from the town of Thalassery.This uninhabited island is covered with a canopy of coconut palms and dense bushes, surrounded by mainland rivers on three sides and the sea on the other. One can approach it only at low tide, and strolls around the place give one a brilliant view of the confluence of the Anjarakandy and Thalassery Rivers.
