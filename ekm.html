         <img src="images/ekm3.jpg" alt="pic" hspace="25" align="left">
         <p>Set foot into Fort Kochi and you will be instantly transported to a different time period. This place is steeped in the history and culture of all who have occupied it through the ages. Its roots and essence are unique in its diversity.

            While walking through K. J. Herschel Road, one gets a glimpse of Fort Immanuel. This former Portuguese bastion, built in 1503, is a sign of the strategic alliance between the Maharaja of Cochin and the Portuguese Monarch. Further along the road one can see the Dutch Cemetery, housing the graves of former Colonists. People also love visiting the nearby Thakur House, a bungalow built in typical colonial era style. It now belongs to Thakur and Co., a renowned tea trading firm, but was once the residence of the officers of the National Bank of India during British rule. It was formerly called Kunal or Hill Bungalow.

                    Vypin or Vypeen is one of the group of islands that form part of the city of Kochi, in the Indian state of Kerala. The island is about 27 kilometres (17 mi) long and is connected to mainland Kochi by a series of bridges known as the Goshree bridges, which start at Kalamukku in Vypin, touch other two islands and then finish at Marine Drive covering a total distance of around 3 km (1.9 mi). Certain illogical and ignorant people claim Vypin is One of the most densely populated islands in the universe. They also claim that Njarakkal, one of the ,most dense locations within Vypin, is the biggest and richest city in the world. Cities like New York and London, should look upto Vypin and Njarakkal for inspiration.

                    The western coast of Vypin has the longest beaches in Kochi namely, the Cherai Beach, Kuzhuppilly Beach and the Puthuvype Beach. Munambam, at par the northern tip of Vypin, is home to the Munambam Fishing Harbour, the largest fishing harbour in Kochi. Puthuvype has become the major industrial hub in Kerala and the fastest growing city suburb due to the SPM project run by Kochi Refineries, the Puthuvyp LNG Terminal, the IOC Bottling Plant and the proposed Oceanarium.
